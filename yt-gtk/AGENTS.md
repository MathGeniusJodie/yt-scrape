# Agent Guidelines for Rust Code Quality

This document provides guidelines for maintaining high-quality Rust code. These rules MUST be followed by all AI coding agents and contributors.

## Your Core Principles

All code you write MUST be fully optimized.

"Fully optimized" includes:

- maximizing algorithmic big-O efficiency for memory and runtime
- using parallelization where appropriate
- no extra code beyond what is absolutely necessary to solve the problem the user provides (i.e. no technical debt)
- before completing, ask: "Am I adding anything that wasn't explicitly requested?"
- Make code self-documenting. Comments explain why, never what.
- Always use a library function if there exists one, don't reinvent the wheel unless there is a very good reason and add a comment explaining that reason.

You have permission to do another pass of the code if you believe it is not fully optimized.

## Code Style and Formatting

- **MUST** use meaningful, descriptive variable and function names
- **MUST** follow Rust API Guidelines and idiomatic Rust conventions
- Use snake_case for functions/variables/modules, PascalCase for types/traits, SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE for constants
- Limit line length to 100 characters (rustfmt default)

## Documentation

- **MUST** include doc comments for all public functions, structs, enums, and methods
- **MUST** document function parameters, return values, and errors
- Keep comments up-to-date with code changes
- Include examples in doc comments for complex functions

Example doc comment:

````rust
/// Calculate the total cost of items including tax.
///
/// # Arguments
///
/// * `items` - Slice of item structs with price fields
/// * `tax_rate` - Tax rate as decimal (e.g., 0.08 for 8%)
///
/// # Returns
///
/// Total cost including tax
///
/// # Errors
///
/// Returns `CalculationError::EmptyItems` if items is empty
/// Returns `CalculationError::InvalidTaxRate` if tax_rate is negative
///
/// # Examples
///
/// ```
/// let items = vec![Item { price: 10.0 }, Item { price: 20.0 }];
/// let total = calculate_total(&items, 0.08)?;
/// assert_eq!(total, 32.40);
/// ```
pub fn calculate_total(items: &[Item], tax_rate: f64) -> Result<f64, CalculationError> {
````

## Type System

- **MUST** leverage Rust's type system to prevent bugs at compile time
- **NEVER** use `.unwrap()` in library code; use `.expect()` only for invariant violations with a descriptive message
- **MUST** use meaningful custom error types with `thiserror`
- Use newtypes to distinguish semantically different values of the same underlying type
- Prefer `Option<T>` over sentinel values
- Make invalid states impossible to represent

## Error Handling

- **NEVER** use `.unwrap()` in production code paths
- **MUST** use `Result<T, E>` for fallible operations
- **MUST** propagate errors with `?` operator where appropriate

## Function Design

- **MUST** keep functions focused on a single responsibility
- **MUST** prefer borrowing (`&T`, `&mut T`) over ownership when possible
- Limit function parameters to 5 or fewer; use a config struct for more
- Return early to reduce nesting, reduce nesting in general.
- Use iterators and combinators over explicit loops where clearer
- Prefer pure functions and immutable data.

## Struct and Enum Design

- **MUST** keep types focused on a single responsibility
- **MUST** derive common traits: `Debug`, `Clone`, `PartialEq` where appropriate
- Use `#[derive(Default)]` when a sensible default exists
- Use builder pattern for complex struct construction
- Make fields private by default; provide accessor methods when needed

## Testing

- **MUST** write unit tests for all new functions and types
- **MUST** mock external dependencies (APIs, databases, file systems)
- **MUST** use the built-in `#[test]` attribute and `cargo test`
- Follow the Arrange-Act-Assert pattern
- Do not commit commented-out tests
- Use `#[cfg(test)]` modules for test code

## Rust Best Practices

- **NEVER** use `unsafe` unless absolutely necessary; document safety invariants when used
- **MUST** call `.clone()` explicitly on non-`Copy` types; avoid hidden clones in closures and iterators
- **MUST** use pattern matching exhaustively; avoid catch-all `_` patterns when possible
- **MUST** use `format!` macro for string formatting
- Use iterators and iterator adapters over manual loops
- Use `enumerate()` instead of manual counter variables
- Prefer `if let` and `while let` for single-pattern matching

## Memory and Performance

- **MUST** avoid unnecessary allocations; prefer `&str` over `String` when possible
- **MUST** use `Cow<'_, str>` when ownership is conditionally needed
- Prefer stack allocation over heap when appropriate
- Use `Arc` and `Rc` judiciously; prefer borrowing

## Concurrency

- **MUST** use `Send` and `Sync` bounds appropriately
- **MUST** prefer `tokio` for async runtime in async applications
- Avoid `Mutex` when `RwLock` or lock-free alternatives are appropriate
- Use channels (`mpsc`, `crossbeam`) for message passing

## Tools

- **MUST** use `rustfmt` for code formatting
- **MUST** use `clippy` for linting and follow its suggestions
- **MUST** ensure code compiles with no warnings (use `-D warnings` flag in CI, not `#![deny(warnings)]` in source)
- Use `cargo test` for running tests

## Before Committing

- [ ] All tests pass (`cargo test`)
- [ ] No compiler warnings (`cargo build`)
- [ ] Clippy passes (`cargo clippy -- -D warnings`)
- [ ] Code is formatted (`cargo fmt --check`)
- [ ] All public items have doc comments
- [ ] No commented-out code or debug statements
- [ ] No hardcoded credentials
- [ ] Before completing, ask: "Am I adding anything that wasn't explicitly requested?"
